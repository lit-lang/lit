# Variables

```ruby
a = 1
# => 1

b = 2
# => 2

c = a + b
# => 3

# You can redefine variables
a = "other value"
# => "other value"
```

Using keywords as variables will cause an error:

```ruby
if = 123
# ERROR: SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED
```

## Allowed variable names

Variable names must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or underscore. After that any letter, number or ? and ! is allowed.

```ruby

snake_case = 2
PascalCase = 3
ALL_CAPS = 4
admin? = 5
wow! = 6
cool_right?! = 7
_private = 8
