Lit is my first attempt at language design. My initial goals are:

- **Be pretty straightforward and simple**:
  - If the same concept/syntax could be used in other parts of the language, great!
  - It will be interpreted because this should keep things simpler.
- **Be functional**:
  - I wanna see how far I can go with functions and hashes.
  - It has to have good function support (anonymous, composition, pipe operator).
  - It has to be immutable.
- **I don't know about types yet**:
  - I'll keep them out just for simplicity.
  - I'm not decided on how to handle null values.
- **Be beautiful:**
  - I'm a Rubyist, afterall. So, beautiful code matters.
  - I want to keep the language consistent, though.
- **Don't take it too serious**:
  - This is my first language, so I want it to be fun (and learn from experience).
  - Speed is not a priority.
