## Why are you doing this?

> "There’s an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of creating it." — Rodney Mullen

Well, I think Mr. Mullen already answer it, but if you want more context, I'm interested in how programming languages work and how they're implemented. [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent) got me started with his book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/). It's very accessible for begginners, gave it a try. Hope Lit's codebase can help you in your journey as well.

## Is Lit for real?

If "for real" means "the next hot language on Hacker News", production ready, with a lot of tools, support, etc: **definitely no**.

If "for real" means if I take this language serious and want keep it nice, clean, without bugs: **yep, it is**.

## Does Lit run in X platform?

> "It works on my machine" - Every developer ever

Currently Lit has one user (_me_ o/), so it is tested only on my machine. I should work everywhere Crystal runs, so... most UNIX systems.

## How can I contribute?
